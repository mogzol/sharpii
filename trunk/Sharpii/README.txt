                                  Sharpii 1.2
       <---------------------------------------------------------------->
                               An app by person66
                 libWiiSharp.dll by leathl (mod by scooby74029)                         
/------------------------------------------------------------------------------>



/----DESCRIPTION
/------------------------------>

Sharpii is a command line app that I made, which uses leathl's 
libWiiSharp.dll to perform tasks such as:
         - Pack, unpack, or edit .wad files
         - Pack, and unpack U8 archives
         - Patch IOS .wad files with various patches
         - Convert a .wav file to .bns, and vice versa
         - Convert an image file to a .tpl, and vice versa
         - Send a .dol to the Homebrew Channel over Wi-Fi


/----USAGE
/------------------------------>

I won't go in to detail here, but to see all the commands, just start 
up the command prompt, navigate to the folder containing Sharpii, and type:

                                    Sharpii.exe -h

OR, if you want help with a specific function use

                             Sharpii.exe [function] -h

Where [function] would obviously be replaced with the function you want
help with.

Sharpii uses scooby74029's mod of libWiiSharp.dll by leathl, and 
it borrows some code from some of the examples included with libWiiSharp.

I would also like to thank Xflak and JoostinOnline for doing a bit of beta 
testing for me. Thanks!
